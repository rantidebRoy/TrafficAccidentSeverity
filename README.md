# TrafficAccidentSeverity
Statistical and Predictive Analysis of Traffic Accident Severity  
Project Overview:  
This project focuses on road accidents, which are a serious worldwide issue that 
result in fatalities, serious injuries, and financial losses. Improved road safety 
tactics can be created by having a better understanding of the variables that 
affect accident severity. In order to find trends, test theories, and eventually 
create a predictive regression model to predict accident severity, statistical 
analysis of a traffic accident dataset is the aim. To evaluate data distribution, 
normality, and correlations between variables, the study will employ both 
descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. In addition to global datasets, 
the project will also place special emphasis on analyzing traffic accident data 
from Bangladesh to address local road safety challenges. 
Tool and Technologies:  
• Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development environment for coding and 
visualization. 
• Python Libraries: 
• NumPy – Numerical computations. 
• Pandas – Data cleaning, manipulation, and grouping. 
• Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization and plotting. 
• SciPy – Statistical tests (Shapiro test, KS test, parametric & non
parametric tests). 
• Scikit-learn – Building and evaluating predictive models. 
Objectives:  
The main objectives of this project are: 
1. To clean and preprocess the traffic accident dataset for analysis. 
2. To apply descriptive statistical measures (mean, median, mode, standard 
deviation, skewness, kurtosis). 
3. To assess the normality of data distributions using Shapiro-Wilk and 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. 
4. To conduct parametric and non-parametric statistical tests to identify 
significant factors affecting accident severity. 
5. To build and evaluate a regression model for predicting accident severity 
based on available features. 
6. Insights into Bangladesh’s traffic accident patterns, alongside global 
analysis, to support localized road safety improvements. 
Methodology:  
• Data Cleaning & Preparation 
• Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. 
• Encoding categorical variables if required. 
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
• Grouping data by relevant columns (e.g., weather, road type, time of 
day). 
• Calculating central tendency and dispersion measures. 
• Visualizing distributions, correlations, and patterns. 
• Statistical Analysis 
• Normality testing (Shapiro, KS test). 
• Parametric tests (t-test, ANOVA). 
• Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis). 
• Predictive Modeling 
• Splitting dataset into training and testing sets. 
• Building a regression model (Linear Regression / Logistic Regression 
depending on target variable). 
• Interpretation & Insights 
• Summarizing key findings from statistical tests and regression. 
• Drawing conclusions about major contributing factors to accident 
severity. 
Expected Outcomes:  
• A cleaned and well-structured dataset ready for analysis. 
• Statistical summary of accident severity based on various factors. 
• Identification of significant variables that influence accident severity. 
• A regression-based predictive model that can estimate accident severity. 
• Visualizations and insights that can help stakeholders in decision-making 
for road safety measures.
